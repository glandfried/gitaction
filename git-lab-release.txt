1) Create a tag for your commit

git tag -a MY_TAG_NAME 30728cab

2) Push the tag to your remote repository

git push REMOTE_REPO_NAME REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME MY_TAG_NAME

3) Upload a file

curl --request POST --header "Private-Token: YOUR_PRIVATE_TOKEN" --form "file=@/PATH/TO/THE/FILE/file.txt" "https://MY_GITLAB_HOSTING.COM/api/v4/projects/MY_PROJECT_ID/uploads"

WARNING: There is no official way to delete the uploaded binary from the GitLab repository then - I recommend to save it to some other hosting and just save the link!

4) Create a release

curl --request POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header "Private-Token: YOUR_PRIVATE_TOKEN" --data '{"name": "MY_RELEASE_NAME", "tag_name": "MY_TAG_NAME", "description": "Release with the binary LINK_TO_YOUR_BINARY"}' "https://MY_GITLAB_HOSTING.COM/api/v4/projects/MY_PROJECT_ID/releases"
