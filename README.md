# Git Good Practices

## Git

### [Write a good commit](https:/u/chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

### [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

0. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
0. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
0. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Github

### [Large binaries files](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/distributing-large-binaries)
